Software engineer with software development and analytics experience at the forefront of robotics, healthcare and actuarial practices. My career goal is to gain further experience in an engineering role and to take charge and lead mission-critical projects in support of business operations and to achieve business objectives. I believe adherence to principle and integrity is the key to high quality work.

## Work Experience
### Analytics Developer | Hymans Robertson | March 2020 - present
* Assisted actuaries and quantitative analysts in the development and testing of models used for investment risk modelling and pension liabilities forecasting.
* Developed a basic understanding of actuarial principles and practices through hands-on experience. 
* Led the development of an automated approach for robustly performing periodic calculations of strategic asset allocations and portfolio optimisation.
* Developed APIs from models to be used by independent financial advisors (IFAs) using Docker and Microsoft Azure.
* Analysed use of economic scenario data by applications and homogenised into a single retrieval API using NoSQL data storage and bespoke caching tools for low-latency access. 
* Designed and developed YAML-based Azure release pipelines for continuously deploying new client applications in a parameterized approach. 
* Organised and led engineering discussions for multiple propositions remotely.

### Machine Learning Research Associate | University of Strathclyde | November 2019 - May 2020
* Continuation of postgraduate research in machine learning in healthcare as received new funding.
* Developed Pytorch / python-based framework for creating novel transformer architectures in an extensible way and automatically evaluating their effectiveness on cloud-based high-performance compute (HPC) instances.
* Implemented custom continuous integration and continuous deployment approach using Git, YAML, and Google Cloud Storage.
* Presented research at HealTac2020, an NLP in healthcare conference.



### Java Software Engineer | Ocado Technology | September 2019 - March 2020
* Worked on ‘Dash’ – the low-latency and real time automation and control system used within Ocado’s state of the art customer fulfilment centres.
* Engaged in a variety of project management tasks including sprint planning and costing, retrospectives and blitzes.
* Worked with Jenkins as part of the continuous integration processes for improving code quality.
* Streamlined and improved code design by identifying points of refactor and applying object-oriented design principles such as SOLID.
* Implemented features such as new grid artefacts and improve bot planning and control, increasing grid performance and improving business KPIs.
* Managed support and maintenance tasks such as deploying new software to live physical environments and monitoring for failures and liaising with grid staff when failures or unusual system behavior occurred.
* Gained experience in using Cassandra and Kubernetes as part of software deployments.

### OO Software Engineering Tutor | University of Glasgow | September 2015 - March 2016
* Led classroom sessions for teaching Object-oriented software development in Java to 30 students twice a week for two semesters.
* Managed the incremental project-based assessments for each student including marking and grading totaling 50% of their course grade.


## Education
### MSc Advanced Computing Science | Distinction | University of Strathclyde | 2019
* Studied a variety of subjects including machine learning for software development and machine learning in finance.
* Developed novel approach to predicting hospital readmission from clinical text as part of my postgraduate thesis.
* Gained intern experience in a health analytics startup and collaborated with NHS health informatics researchers in diabetes for my postgraduate research thesis.

### BSc(Hons) Computing  | Second class | University of Glasgow | 2016
* Received best project prize from Morgan Stanley for my project TweetDesk – a web application built around an event detection model for Twitter.
* Designed and developed a distributed application using Apache Storm and Apache Kafka for the online classification and clustering of tweets for my final year project.
* Co-authored short paper on visualizing twitter events which was published at ACM’s SIGIR 2014 conference.
